## Description
As a developer I store and deploy applications from GitHub. A README helps other developers see a quick guide of my application, licensing, required installation steps , and gives a concise overview for use. <br>
With each application that I create I find myself needing a quicker way to input my README information. This README Generator will make creating a professional README more streamlined and ensure all projects include necessary information.
